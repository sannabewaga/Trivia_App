#True/False Trivia App

This is a True/False trivia application built in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for the structure. The app fetches trivia questions from an online API and presents them to the user in a simple and interactive interface.

True/False Buttons: Users can answer trivia questions by clicking on the "True" or "False" buttons provided for each question.
Feedback: After answering a question, users receive immediate feedback indicating whether their answer was correct or incorrect.
Score Tracking: The app keeps track of the user's score throughout the trivia session, updating it with each correct or incorrect answer.
